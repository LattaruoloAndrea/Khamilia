It's a chat based application in which you provide a description of your day, given this description Geminy AI will extract information as the activities performed during that day and the emotions/moods that the used inserted. The user can ask queries to the chat asking for a range of dates of specific days to check it's data (this data can also be seen in a dedicated page). The app can help users to understand better how they live their life for example for people who follow a psychotherapy path this might help discover some data, so it has can be also used in a medical field. There is also an experimental function in which the users can track their sports activities always using the chat provided in the app. So Gemini AI is used basically in 2 ways extract info from what is written in the chat for example it will extract activities, emotions or the sports based, it can detect if the user is asking for help and if it't performing a query. Another way it's used is to display the data to the users especially the data of activities and emotions which will be grouped together for the activities in 5 groups: hobby, sports, social,work,learning. For emotions it will provide a description of the list of emotion.
