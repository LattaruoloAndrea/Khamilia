But how does khami work then? Well you provided your daily description then informations as the activies and emotions/moods are extracted. 

Have you ever wonder if there are activities that makes us fell in a certain way?
With khami you can now get a better understanding of what is going on in your life. By collecting daily entry Khami will try to track the cause and effect between activities and emotions.

If you are wondering I am not sure if it the right app for me. Well it can be used by anyone for any reason, to keep track of your activities, or maybe you just want a journal or what if I am following a rehabilitation path and I want get a better understanding of myself,
every user can decide what information to give. 

What if I don't feel like putting my emotions and moods on this app but still wanted to use it? Well it's simple you will get the list of activities 
but without emotions it will not be possible to do any correlations between activites and mood.

Not conviced yet? We are exeprimenting also a section for progression activies which mainy are the sports.
