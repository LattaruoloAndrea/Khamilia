Style cartoon, two puppets talking to each other in intervals.
They use the following dialogue
puppet-1 : “Hello Blair, how is it going lately?”
puppet-2: “Hi Ezekiel, I have been busy lately so many things to do that I feel like I could explode”
puppet-1: “Have you ever tried using a manager for scheduling your activities?”
puppet-2: “I tried a few options but they were all lacking of something and tidius to use!”
puppet-1: “Have you ever tried Kamilia? It's a software that helps you to track your activities. it's a simple as to send a message to one of your friends. It can help you also to track your emotions. it is simple to use and can provide useful information on your lifestyle. For example if you give a description of your day it will extract the activities and your emotions, this with some time can be used to inference if some activities are involved with a specific emotion!”
puppet-2: “Sounds like magic!”
puppet-1: “Well you know it is powered by GeminyAI, and it can do more stuff, for example I have been going to the gym lately and I am tracking my gym progression by just sending a message! as simple as that”
puppet-2:"That would be great for my swimming! Do you reckon I can send my swimming progression? "
puppet-1: "From what I understood the progression can be applied to any activity that allow a progression for example I usually send hey kami today at the gym I have been squatting 80kg 5 sets of 8 rep each, and I can see the graph of the squat exercice"
puppet-2: “That seem very helpful indeed. I will give it a try how did you call it again Kamilia was it?”
puppet-1 “That's right Kamilia, your journal assistant.”
